## Description

The aim of this project is to test and strengthen of problem-solving abilities and adaptability of Holberton School students. it serves as an opportunity to foster collaboration skills by encouraging students to work in pairs, simulating real-world work environment.

## Printf  Project

printf is well-known function in c programming is to formatted printing. typically, it requires only the standard library to be included in a C program. it allows for printing simple strings or formatted specifiers that enable the printing of various data types. we've developed a custom printf project from scratch, incorporating many of its features to gain insight into the complexity of this powerful tool. Refer to man 3 printf to.


## Compilation
all files are compile using this: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c

## Prototype
